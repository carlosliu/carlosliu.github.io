title: Some front-end documents in Chinese
---

After leaving my last job, I had some free time while preparing interviews. It's the prefect opportunity to refresh my Chinese writing skills, which has "degraded" a little bit after living in NZ for 12 years. Therefore, I decided to tranlate some documents related to front-end development, which could be helpful to my fellow Chinese developers.

The first document is [_AngularJS in Patterns_](https://mgechev.github.io/angularjs-in-patterns/), written by the well known Angular Developer [Minko Gechev](http://blog.mgechev.com). It is a peek into the internal mechanism of AngularJS. You can find my translation at [AngularJS 模式](https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-in-patterns/blob/master/i18n/README-zh-cn.md).

The other document is [_Front-end Developer Interview Questions_](http://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/). The previous Chinese version is **only** 7 months old, but is already completly outdated and out-of-sync with English version. It is really fun to go through those questions and realize the rapid evolution of front-end development. Please check out [前端工作面试问题](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/tree/master/Translations/Chinese) for the updated Chinese version.

If you want to improve the translation, please don't hesitate to open a pull request.
