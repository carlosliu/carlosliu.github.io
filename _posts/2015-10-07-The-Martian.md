title: Science the shit out of this
---

I was so excited to noticed the movie clip of [_The Martian_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/) while Apple used it to [introudce iPad Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlYC8gDvutc) in September. One month later, I watched the movie, and finished [the book](http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025). It's awesome. It's long, but not dragged. It's like [_Cast Away_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222), one of my favorite movies, but more humorous and less depression. It's the ultimate future version of [_Apollo 13_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13), only better. It's all about science, understandable science, instead of unimaginable [_Interstellar_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692). It has Chinese with a good plot, rather than [disgusting commercials](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2109248).

I got goosebumps when Mark Watney said "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this."

Only one complaint, I'm definitely not happy with the "Iron Man" move which Mark never execute in the book.
