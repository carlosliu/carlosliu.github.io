title: Science the shit out of this
---

I was so excited to watch the trailer clip of [_The Martian_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/) while Apple used it to [introduce iPad Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlYC8gDvutc#t=2m27s) in September. One month later, I watched the movie and finished [the book](http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025). It's awesome. It's long, but not dragged. It's like [_Cast Away_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222), one of my favorite movies, but more humorous and less depression. It's the (near) future version of [_Apollo 13_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384) happened on Mars. It's all about science, understandable science, instead of unimaginable [_Interstellar_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692). It's Sci-Fi but feel very realistic because almost all of those technologies are already existed today, only more efficient. It put Chinese in a reasonable plot, rather than [some disgusting commercials](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2109248).

I got goosebumps when Mark Watney said "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." In fact, I heard that the author, Andy Weir, wrote his own orbital trajectory simulation software to calculate the accurate value of mission dates, transmission time, etc. That's incredible.

At the end, I have only one complaint about the movie. I'm definitely not happy with the "Iron Man" move which Mark didn't execute in the book.
