title: Up and running, again!

Heard about [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from a mailing list few days ago. It is another static website generator hosted on GitHub.

Simply fork the project and give it a minimum setting, it is ready to go. No need to touch command line, no need to install any tool on my local computer.

Fantastic, let me (re)start blogging, again!
