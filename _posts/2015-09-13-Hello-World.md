Heard about [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from a mailing list few days ago. It is *another* static website generator hosted on GitHub. Except that no need to touch command line , no need to install any dev environment in local computer.

Fantastic, let's start blogging, again!
